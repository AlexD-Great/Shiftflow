## What's Different from Wave 1

### Documentation Tone

**Before** (AI-generated feel):
```
✅ Complete SideShift API integration
✅ Workflow engine with condition monitoring  
✅ Price oracle integration (CoinGecko)
🎉 You're Ready!
```

**After** (Authentic):
```
I built ShiftFlow because I was tired of manually monitoring prices 
and executing swaps across different chains. The idea is simple: 
define what you want to happen and when, then let the system handle it.
```

### Professional Presentation

- Removed excessive emojis
- Natural language flow
- Personal perspective
- Technical credibility
- Honest about what works and what's planned
