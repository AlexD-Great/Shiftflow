## 💡 The Problem

You want to swap ETH to BTC when the price dips below $3,000—but only when gas fees are low. You could:
- ❌ Watch the charts 24/7
- ❌ Set price alerts and manually execute
- ❌ Miss the opportunity while you sleep

**Or you could use ShiftFlow.**

---

## ✨ What ShiftFlow Does

ShiftFlow is a **conditional automation platform** for cross-chain DeFi. You define the conditions, we execute the actions.

### Real-World Examples:

**🎯 Smart DCA Strategy**
> "Swap $100 USDC to ETH every Monday at 9 AM, but only if gas is below 30 gwei"

**💰 Profit Taking**
> "When SOL hits $200, swap 50% to USDC and send to my Safe multi-sig"

**⛽ Gas Optimization**
> "Execute my treasury rebalancing, but wait for gas to drop below 20 gwei"

**🔄 Auto-Rebalancing**
> "Keep my portfolio 60% ETH, 40% BTC. Rebalance when it drifts more than 5%"

---

## 🎬 How It Works

### 1️⃣ **Define Your Conditions**

Use the visual workflow builder to set your triggers:

```
WHEN: ETH price drops below $3,000
AND: Gas price is below 20 gwei
THEN: Swap 0.5 ETH to BTC via SideShift
```

### 2️⃣ **Connect Your Wallet**

- Connect MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any Web3 wallet
- Optionally use a Safe (Gnosis Safe) multi-sig for team treasuries
- All transactions require your approval

### 3️⃣ **Monitor in Real-Time**

- Dashboard shows live workflow status
- See current prices vs. your thresholds
- Get notified when conditions are met

### 4️⃣ **Automatic Execution**

- ShiftFlow monitors 24/7
- When conditions match, the workflow executes
- You get the swap at the perfect moment

---

## ⚡ Gas Optimization & Cost Efficiency

### **Why Gas Matters**

On Ethereum mainnet, a simple swap can cost $50-200 in gas fees during peak times. ShiftFlow helps you avoid this.

### **Our Gas Optimization Strategy**

**1. Off-Chain Orchestration**
- All workflow logic runs off-chain (no gas costs)
- Only the final swap transaction requires gas
- No smart contracts to deploy or maintain

**2. L2-First Execution**
- SideShift supports Arbitrum, Optimism, and other L2s
- Execute swaps for $0.10-1.00 instead of $50+
- 50-100x gas savings vs. Ethereum mainnet

**3. Gas-Aware Conditions**
```
IF ETH price < $3,000 AND gas < 20 gwei
THEN execute swap
```
- Combine price + gas conditions
- Only execute when both are favorable
- Typical savings: 40-60% on gas fees

**4. Batch-Friendly Design**
- Multi-step workflows execute in sequence
- Reduce total transaction count
- Optimize for gas efficiency

### **Real Cost Comparison**

| Operation | Ethereum Mainnet | Arbitrum (via SideShift) | Savings |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Simple Swap | $50-200 | $0.50-2 | 99% |
| Multi-Step | $150-500 | $1-5 | 98% |
| DCA (monthly) | $600-2,400/year | $12-60/year | 95-98% |

### **Gas Optimization Tips**

1. **Use L2s** - Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon for 99% lower fees
2. **Set gas conditions** - Wait for low-fee periods
3. **Batch operations** - Combine multiple actions
4. **Time strategically** - Execute during off-peak hours (weekends, late night UTC)

## 🔐 Crypto UX & Safety Guide

### **Non-Custodial Architecture**

**You Always Control Your Funds**
- ShiftFlow never holds your assets
- All swaps execute through SideShift's non-custodial protocol
- Your private keys stay in your wallet

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow conditions met → ShiftFlow creates SideShift shift
2. You receive deposit address
3. You send funds from your wallet (you control timing)
4. SideShift processes swap
5. You receive funds at your destination address

### **Understanding Slippage & Risks**

**What is Slippage?**
- Difference between expected and actual swap price
- Caused by market volatility and liquidity

**ShiftFlow's Approach:**
- SideShift provides fixed-rate quotes (30-second validity)
- Quotes lock in the rate before you deposit
- No surprise slippage on execution

**Risk Management:**
- Start with small test amounts
- Use price conditions to avoid bad entries
- Set stop-loss conditions for downside protection
- Monitor dashboard regularly

### **Funding Your Swaps Safely**

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Workflow triggers** → You get notification
2. **Review details** → Check deposit address, amount, rate
3. **Verify on SideShift** → Cross-check shift ID on sideshift.ai
4. **Send funds** → Transfer from your wallet
5. **Track progress** → Monitor on dashboard

**Safety Checklist:**
- ✅ Always verify deposit addresses
- ✅ Start with small test transactions
- ✅ Double-check network (Ethereum vs. Arbitrum vs. Polygon)
- ✅ Confirm rate before sending
- ✅ Keep transaction records

### **Multi-Sig for Teams (Safe Integration)**

**Why Use Safe?**
- Require multiple approvals for large swaps
- Protect against single points of failure
- Perfect for DAO treasuries

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow creates Safe transaction proposal
2. Owners review and sign
3. When threshold met, transaction executes
4. All on-chain and transparent

**Best Practices:**
- Use 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 for balance of security and speed
- Set appropriate thresholds for different amounts
- Test with small amounts first

### **Security Best Practices**

**Wallet Security:**
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- ✅ Never share private keys or seed phrases
- ✅ Verify all transaction details before signing
- ✅ Keep software updated

**Workflow Security:**
- ✅ Test workflows with small amounts first
- ✅ Set reasonable limits on amounts
- ✅ Use stop-loss conditions
- ✅ Monitor execution regularly

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't set overly aggressive conditions
- ❌ Don't ignore gas costs in profit calculations
- ❌ Don't forget to fund wallets for gas
- ❌ Don't skip testing on small amounts

### **Emergency Procedures**

**If Something Goes Wrong:**

1. **Workflow executing incorrectly?**
   - Deactivate immediately on dashboard
   - Review conditions and fix
   - Test with small amount before reactivating

2. **Swap stuck or delayed?**
   - Check SideShift status page
   - Contact SideShift support with shift ID
   - Most delays resolve within 30 minutes

3. **Wrong network or amount?**
   - Contact SideShift support immediately
   - Provide shift ID and transaction hash
   - Do not send additional funds

- SideShift Support: support@sideshift.ai
- ShiftFlow Issues: GitHub Issues
- Community: Discord (link in repo)
